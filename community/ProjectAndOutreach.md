  10. Image based object recognition and advanced diffing.
 
Ambitious? Yes! Doable? Absolutely! Together we can.

## Arjuna Project - Community Outreach Activities
Before reaching out to a wider community, we should plan for Arjuna contributor meetups. That would be a great way to exchange ideas in a quikcer and better fashion.

These acitvities would be kick-started from January 2020, post product readiness of Arjuna and Arjuna-Java:
* Monthly workshop on weekend (Free/cost-to-cost)
* Webinars
* Updates in social networking automation related groups
* Creation of relevant tag(s) in Quora and StackOverflow
* Call to Organization for PoCs.
