# Areas and Guidelines for Contributors

Test Mile OSS efforts are incomplete without contributors from the community. Please write to support@testmile.com to let us know which area(s) you would like to be associated in.

Following are the areas where contributors can make a great difference in the development of Arjuna:

## Testing Arjuna Features
Arjuna is currently marked in pre-release version. As it is meant to be used in production, before we get there, it has to be tested throughly. 

Following are different activities which contributors can take up:
* Documenting feature-wise key test ideas. The ideas need to be categorized into ideas for Arjuna and ideas for Arjuna language bindings.
* Writing simple to understand automated tests (where possible and where automation makes sense) from the above pool.
* Exploratory testing of Arjuna and Arjuna language bindings.

## Developing Language Bindings
As Arjuna is meant to be a multi-language engine, we need to create language bindings for different popular programming languages.

By Dec 2019, the Java bindings would be feature complete for Configuration, Data driven testing and Selenium. This implementation would act as a reference for other language implementations.

Python based implementation is included in the Arjuna library and is closely maintained by Test Mile.

For non-Python implementations (including Java), separate GitHub repositories will be used. You can choose to become a GitHub contriubtor to them as a developer.

More details in this area would be published in Jan 2019.

## Documentation and Education
You can assist in the documentation effort for Arjuna. 

You can also choose to blog about it, write LinkedIn articles or create videos on YouTube in your own accounts as well.

Arjuna is a new project, so we need to ensure that enough useful information is available for all to get started and delve deeper.

## Sample Projects
Nothing works for teaching like implemented practical examples.

Here's something which can be done:
* Pick a public, free web application.
* Identify 20-25 use cases which fully exercise the system.
* Create a public repository on GitHub in your account.
* Create code using Selenium directly for these use cases as a reference.
* Create Arjuna project (currently using Java bindings) for the same use cases.
* Include any information that you find would be useful for those looking at your project.

If we have 4-5 such completed implementations, it goes a long way for organizations and teams to see what all could be done with Arjuna and how to do it in a proper manner.

## Caution
We all are going to learn a lot when we take up any of the above said activities.

Having said that, learning itself is not the primary outcome of contribution. It is the by-product of contribution. 

So, pick up areas where you think you can create a difference. 

In any case, Test Mile is here to assist you and is thankful to you for your consideration.
