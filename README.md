TestMile Arjuna is the next generation test automation framework written in Python programming create by Rahul Verma.

It includes UniTEE, a test engine that espouses the principles of Test Encapsulation by Rahul, as envisioned in a research paper in 2010.  It also combines pragmatism by including decisions which are taken outside of the test for performance reasons.

It includes Setu, based on Rahul Verma's work on FaaST (Framework as a Service for Testing) architecture.

You'd need Python 3.5+ to make use of Arjuna.

Note: On Linux, the built-in Python3 build has issues with the Python's built-in enum module which is heavily used in Arjuna. One alternative is to install ActiveState Python on linux. Advanced users can go for installing a custom Python build.
